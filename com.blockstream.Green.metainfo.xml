				<ul>
					<li>New UI and UX: the user experience has been simplified and streamlined with a more polished, intuitive interface for easier access to key features</li>
					<li>All-in-one UX: use your existing wallets for both your Bitcoin and Liquid accounts across singlesig and assisted multisig. You have the flexibility to choose whether to combine Bitcoin and Liquid accounts or not, and thus to organize your mainchain and second-layer stacks as you deem fit.</li>
					<li>Simpler onboarding for new Jade users, minimizing ambiguity and errors during the initial setup</li>
					<li>Sign with address to prove its ownership</li>
